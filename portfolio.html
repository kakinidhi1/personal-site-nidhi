          This is the quiz I created which was implemented with JavaScript, HTML,
          and CSS. The quiz asked a series of questions such as the users
          favorite food and season and then outputed the best reccommended
          metropolitan area for the user.

          I created a mobile app which assits with the gift giving process. If
          someone has trouble finding the perfect gift for someone, this is the
          app that can help! All the user has to do is input the age and gender
          of the recipient of the gift as well as the event they are attending
          and their budget range and then the app will output the most
          reccomended gift item based off of that specific criteria.
        </p>
        <p class="instructions">
          The images above show one possible outcome generated from the app.
          Above, it shows that the user chose annviersay as their event, $0- $50
          as their budget, and female as the gender. The app then outputed the
          best reccommend gift option as a chocolate and candy bouquet.
